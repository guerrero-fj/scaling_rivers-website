Hi there! We chose Wolheim et al's paper [Superlinear scaling of riverine biogechemical function with watershed size](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28630-z) for one of our team's science discussions. We are currently collecting metabolic data across the Yakima River Basin. We use this data to inform models than can help us predict respiration rates at an unmeasured locations, and also identify places with high uncertainty to refine our sampling scheme.

In what follows, we present a summary of the paper and dive into the underlaying concepts of allometric scaling.

# Plain language summary

Rivers connect multiple components of the earth system: land, oceans, and atmosphere. Through these connections, rivers regulate the metabolism of nutrients like carbon (i.e., biogeochemical function). Currently, researchers can estimate the metabolic rate of a stream reach or even a catchment. It is unknown, however, how to calculate the metabolic rate of an entire continent or on a global scale. According to the authors, riverine metabolic rates increase faster than accumulated watershed areas (superlinear scaling). By using allometric scaling, the researchers show how river network shape, discharge, and local metabolic rates influence the relationship between biogeochemical function and watershed area. According to these findings, large basins contribute disproportionately to global carbon metabolism.

# Before diving in...a pop quiz!

## Question 1: Name the following

![Natural and abstract patterns in nature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guerrero-fj/scaling_rivers-assets/main/images/fractals_pop_quiz_gray.png){fig-alt="Three pictures aligned in a single row showing a river delta, a type of broccoli, and a famous fractal structure: The cantor's set"}

## Question 2: What do these three things have in common?

Here is a hint:

![The branching pattern of the cantor's set.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guerrero-fj/scaling_rivers-assets/main/images/fractal_pop_quiz_hint.png){fig-alt="The cantor's set: an initial line segment is cut into thirds and the central piece is removed. The process is repeated over agin on the newly generated segments in a branching pattern."}

The keyword we are looking for is \*\*fractals\*\*. Have you ever heard about them? If the concept sounds too foreing, let's \*break it down\* into pieces:

According to the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/word/fractal)a fractal is ""never-ending pattern," 1975, from French fractal, ultimately from Latin fractus "interrupted, irregular," literally "broken," past participle of frangere "to break" (from PIE root [bhreg](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*bhreg-?ref=etymonline_crossreference "Etymology, meaning and definition of *bhreg-") "to break"). Coined by French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (1924-2010) in "Les Objets Fractals.""

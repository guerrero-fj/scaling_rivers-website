We are glad you are here!

## Who are we?

A team of River corridor scientists working at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. My name is Francisco Guerrero and I maintain this website. 

## So, what is this? 

This website is an evolving invitation to collaborate. We want to scale up local river metabolism 
data across the entire riverine network. This effort started with a discussion of Wolheim et al's paper [# Superlinear scaling of riverine biogechemical function with watershed size](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28630-z). 

## Our roadmap

We have discussed some of the basic concepts in the paper sumary you can find here. We will be adding data to explore fundamental ideas about allometric scaling in river networks.

Do you want to join us? Fork this repo and reach out. Shoot me an email to francisco.guerrero@pnnl.gov.

Let's get started!

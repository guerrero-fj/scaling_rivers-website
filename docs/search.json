We are currently collecting metabolic data across the Yakima River Basin. We use this data to inform models than can help us predict respiration rates at an unmeasured locations, and also identify places with high uncertainty to refine our sampling scheme.\nIn what follows, we present a summary of the paper and dive into the underlaying concepts of allometric scaling."

Have you ever heard about them? If the concept sounds too foreing, let’s *break it down* into pieces:\nAccording to the Online Etymology Dictionarya fractal is ““never-ending pattern,” 1975, from French fractal, ultimately from Latin fractus “interrupted, irregular,” literally “broken,” past participle of frangere “to break” (from PIE root bhreg “to break”). Coined by French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (1924-2010) in “Les Objets Fractals.””"
